"""Structure moves: add a level, remove a level, switch a dataset off.

Each one is a new model file (a new *structure* in the ledger) whose free
vector shares every key with the parent except the level being added or
removed, so parameters move between the two by key.  Levels are always
appended at the end of the file and removed by deactivation (widths zeroed
and fixed, line kept), which keeps the engine's level numbering -- and hence
every existing key -- stable.

The add-level test follows the archive's hard-won rules: pin the candidate's
energy and magnitudes while the interference sign is scanned (a free level
relocates itself into a background-pole basin and the comparison is void),
judge on a local window *and* the global total, and classify the outcome
(accept / collapse / blowup / live-harmful / relocated / reverts) instead of
reading a single chi-squared.
